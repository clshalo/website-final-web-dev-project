<h1> Buttons with warnings</h1>
<p>These buttons have warnings to tell you that you have been warned before you ineviably press them due to your curiosity.</p>
<p>The first button has the ability to make text invisible once it's pressed. It is unknown what the side effects are after pressing the button which is why it has it's warning. DO NOT PRESS!</p>
<h4>Now you see me.</h4>
<h4>Now you won't once you press the button below.</h4>

<p>This next one is a slippery button. There is no feeling of it being slippery once it's pressed, it's just that part of it will slowly fall once it's pressed.</p>
<p>One of our test subjects did fall out of their chair after they pressed the button and after they tried to get up from their chair after the testing was complete. The button must have caused it!</p>
